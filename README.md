# Books-Recommendation-System
In this project, we make Books reccomendation system using Content based and Collaborative Filteringe techniques.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k

There are two approaches for the problem.
## 1. Content Based Methods: 
In this method we basically ocus on features of the items themselves. Here we recommend books on the basis of similarity in book titles with the help of  Cosine Similarity. 

## 2. Collaborative Filtering Methods: 
Collaborative filtering methods are based on collecting and analyzing a large amount of information on user behaviors, activities or preferences and predicting what users will like based on their similarity to other users. There are many types of Collaborative Filtering Methods but we prefer to use Matrix Factorization Technique. This algorithim work by analyzing the user-book rating matrix to identify the relationship between different books.
